        - I spent almost 3 years assisting Prof. Dr Vineeth N Balasubramanian's research at Lab1055. I also collaborated actively with Prof. Dr Wei Guo from the International Field Phenomics Research Laboratory to work on Plant Phenomic problems.

        - "During my time at IITH, I was fortunate enough to publish four peer-reviewed research articles in the area of “Machine Learning with Limited Labeled Data” with a few more still to come. I was also fortunate to have co-authored a chapter in a soon-to-be-published book “Plant Omics: Advances in Big Data Biology”. I feel extremely lucky to have had an opportunity to learn from the brilliant members of the lab on how cutting edge computer science research is done."
