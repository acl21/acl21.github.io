Hi! I work as a **Research Assistant** at the [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/), which [Prof Dr. Abhinav Valada](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/people/valada) leads. At the moment, my research topic is at the intersection of reinforcement learning, world models and real-world robot task learning.

Recently, I completed **M.Sc. Computer Science** at the [University of Freiburg](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/studies/furtherinformation/concentrationCTS?set_language=en). At the [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/), I worked almost two years as a **Student Research Assistant** on several robot manipulation problems, supervised by [Dr. Iman Nematollahi](https://www.imanema.com/) and [Dr. Tim Welschehold](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/people/welschehold):

- For Master's Thesis. I fine-tuned diffusion-based policies inside world models to learn robot behaviours entirely offline (Coming Soon...).
- For Master's Project, I fine-tuned geometry-aware (Riemannian manifold) motion models with model-free RL to stitch up to seven robot skills.

Earlier (2018-2021), I was a full-time **Research Assistant** to [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/) at the Machine Learning and Vision (MLV) research group in [IIT Hyderabad](https://cse.iith.ac.in/), for nearly three years, mainly working on deep active learning for image data. During my time at IIT Hyderabad, I also frequently collaborated with [Dr. Wei Guo](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=pnMyJLEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at the [Field Phenomics Lab](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Field-Phenomics/ninolab/index.html) (University of Tokyo) and worked on several plant phenotyping solutions.
