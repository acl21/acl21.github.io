Hi! I am an M.Sc. Computer Science student at the [University of Freiburg](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/studies/furtherinformation/concentrationCTS?set_language=en). Currently, I work as a Student Research Assistant on robot manipulation problems at Uni-Freiburg's [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/), which [Prof Dr. Abhinav Valada](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/people/valada) leads. I spend most of my days in the lab trying to better define, learn, sequence, and refine robot "skills", supervised by [Iman Nematollahi](https://www.imanema.com/) and [Dr. Tim Welschehold](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/people/welschehold). Specifically, I use reinforcement learning to guide geometry-aware motion models to perform long-horizon manipulation tasks. My current interests are in the intersection of robot and deep reinforcement learning.

Earlier, I was a research assistant at [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/)'s Machine Learning and Vision (MLV) research group at [IIT Hyderabad](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) for nearly three years, mainly working on deep active learning for image data. During my time at IIT Hyderabad, I also frequently collaborated with [Dr. Wei Guo](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=pnMyJLEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at the [Field Phenomics Lab](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Field-Phenomics/ninolab/index.html) (University of Tokyo) and worked on several plant phenotyping solutions.
